  abstract = {The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is becoming increasingly common in the analysis of hydrology and water resources problems. In this research, an ANN was developed and used to model the rainfall-runoff relationship, in a catchment located in a semiarid and Mediterranean climate in Algeria. The performance of the developed neural network-based model was compared against multiple linear regression-based models using the same observed data. It was found that the neural network model consistently gives superior predictions. Based on the results of this research, artificial neural network modeling appears to be a promising technique for the prediction of flow for catchments in semi-arid and Mediterranean regions. Accordingly, the neural network method can be applied to various hydrological systems where other models may be inappropriate.},

  abstract = {River flow forecasting is required to provide basic information on a wide range of problems related to the design and operation of river systems. The availability of extended records of rainfall and other climatic data, which could be used to obtain stream flow data, initiated the practice of rainfall-runoff modelling. While conceptual or physically-based models are of importance in the understanding of hydrological processes, there are many practical situations where the main concern is with making accurate predictions at specific locations. In such situation it is preferred to implement a simple “black box” (data-driven, or machine learning) model to identify a direct mapping between the inputs and outputs without detailed consideration of the internal structure of the physical process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) is probably the most successful machine learning technique with flexible mathematical structure which is capable of identifying complex non-linear relationships between input and output data without attempting to reach understanding as to the nature of the phenomena. In this study the applicability of ANNs for downstream flow forecasting in the Apure river basin (Venezuela) was investigated. Two types of ANN architectures, namely multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and a radial basis function network (RBF) were implemented. The performances of these networks were compared with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and they were found to be slightly better for this river flow-forecasting problem.},

  abstract = {The applicability of the traditionally used overall decomposition-based (ODB) sampling technique in the development of forecasting models is controversial. This study first conducts a systematic investigation of the performance of models developed using the ODB sampling technique. A stepwise decomposition-based (SDB) sampling technique that is consistent with actual forecasting practice is then proposed. Moreover, a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two-stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolutionary approach is formulated to help maintain the performance of models. The application of models produced using these different sampling techniques to four gauging stations in China and Canada indicates that (1) the ODB sampling technique that employ the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) as series decomposition techniques do not produce convincing forecasting models because additional information on the future streamflow that is to be predicted is introduced into the explanatory variables of the samples; (2) the SDB sampling technique strictly excludes information on future streamflow from the explanatory variables and is thus as an appropriate alternative for developing forecasting models; (3) the DWT and VMD techniques benefit models by enhancing their performance; on the other hand, the EMD is unsuitable for use in forecasting, due to the variable number of subseries that result from the implementation of the stepwise decomposition strategy. Finally, methods that can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition-based models and the prediction accuracy of nonstationary streamflow are suggested.},

  abstract = {Regional coupled system models require a high-resolution discharge component to couple their atmosphere/land components to the ocean component and to adequately resolve smaller catchments and the day-to-day variability of discharge. As the currently coupled discharge models usually do not fulfill this requirement, we improved a well-established discharge model, the Hydrological Discharge (HD) model, to be globally applicable at 5 Min. resolution. As the first coupled high-resolution discharge simulations are planned over Europe and the Baltic Sea catchment, we focus on the respective regions in the present study. As no river specific parameter adjustments were conducted and since the HD model parameters depend on globally available gridded characteristics, the model is, in principle, applicable for climate change studies and over ungauged catchments. For the validation of the 5 Min. HD (HD5) model, we force it with prescribed fields of surface and subsurface runoff. As no large-scale observations of these variables exist, they need to be calculated by a land surface scheme or hydrology model using observed or re-analyzed meteorological data. In order to pay regard to uncertainties introduced by these calculations, three different methods and datasets were used to derive the required fields of surface and subsurface runoff for the forcing of the HD5 model. However, the evaluation of the model performance itself is hampered by biases in these fields as they impose an upper limit on the accuracy of simulated discharge. 10-years simulations (2000–2009) show that for many European rivers, where daily discharge observations were available for comparison, the HD5 model captures the main discharge characteristics reasonably well. Deficiencies of the simulated discharge could often be traced back to deficits in the various forcing datasets. As direct anthropogenic impact on the discharge, such as by regulation or dams, is not regarded in the HD model, those effects can generally not be simulated. Thus, discharges for many heavily regulated rivers in Scandinavia or for the rivers Volga and Don are not well represented by the model. The comparison of the three sets of simulated discharges indicates that the HD5 model is suitable to evaluate the terrestrial hydrological cycle of climate models or land surface models, especially with regard to the separation of throughfall (rain or snow melt) into surface and subsurface runoff.},

The recognition of key factors plays a vital role and thus affects the performance of the model. However, there is no conclusion on which recognition algorithm is the most suitable. To address this issue, an LSTM model combined with two attention mechanisms both in the input and hidden layers, namely AT-LSTM, is proposed for long-term runoff forecasting at Yichang and Pingshan stations in China. The added attention mechanisms automatically assign weights to 130 climate phenomenon indexes, avoiding the use of subjectively set recognition algorithms. Results show that the AT-LSTM model outperforms the Pearson’s correlation based LSTM model in terms of four evaluation metrics for monthly runoff forecasting. Further, the set indirect runoff prediction method verifies that the AT-LSTM model also performs effectively in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration forecasting, and the indirect runoff prediction is inferior to the AT-LSTM model to establish a direct link between climate factors and runoff. Finally, four key factors related to runoff are identified by the attention mechanism and their impacts on runoff are analyzed on intra- and inter-annual scales. The proposed AT-LSTM model can effectively improve the accuracy of long-term forecasting and identify the dynamic influence of input factors.},

  abstract = {Accurate long-term streamflow and flood forecasting have always been an important research direction in hydrology research. Nowadays, climate change, floods, and other anomalies occurring more and more frequently and bringing great losses to society. The prediction of streamflow, especially flood prediction, is important for disaster prevention. Current hydrological models based on physical mechanisms can give accurate predictions of streamflow, but the effective prediction period is only about 1 month in advance, which is too short for decision making. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great potential for predicting runoff and is not only good at handling non-linear data but can also make long-period forecasts. However, most of ANN models are unstable in their predictions when faced with raw flow data, and have excessive errors in predicting extreme flows. Previous studies have shown a link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the streamflow of the Yangtze River. In this paper, we use ENSO and the monthly streamflow data of the Yangtze River from 1952 to 2018 to predict the monthly streamflow of the Yangtze River in two extreme flood years and a small flood year by using deep neural networks. In this paper, three deep neural network frameworks are used: stacked long short-term memory, Conv long short-term memory encoder–decoder long short-term memory and Conv long short-term memory encoder–decoder gate recurrent unit. The results show that the use of ConvLSTM improves the stability of the model and increases the accuracy of the flood prediction. Besides, the introduction of ENSO to the experimental data resulted in a more accurate prediction of the time of the occurrence of flood peaks and flood flows. Furthermore, the best results were obtained on the convolutional long short-term memory\,+\,encoder–decoder gate recurrent unit model.},

We assume that K(x) is given by its values on a grid, and we use these values to train the K DNN. The head and concentration DNNs are trained by minimizing the residuals of the flow equation and ADE and using the initial and boundary conditions as additional constraints. The PINN method is applied to one- and two-dimensional forward ADEs, where its performance for various Péclet numbers (Pe) is compared with the analytical and numerical solutions. We find that the PINN method is accurate with errors of less than 1\% and outperforms some conventional discretization-based methods for large Pe. Next, we demonstrate that the PINN method remains accurate for the backward ADEs, with the relative errors in most cases staying under 5\% compared to the reference concentration field. Finally, we show that when available, the concentration measurements can be easily incorporated in the PINN method and significantly improve (by more than 50\% in the considered cases) the accuracy of the PINN solution of the backward ADE.},

Using statistics and forecast skill scores, nowcast skills of 3DCNN were examined with those of a three-dimensional advection nowcast model (3DNOW) which gener­ ates extrapolation-based forecasts with lead time up to 10 min. In analyzing the skill scores, two groups of a total rain area and convective rain area were made by different radar reflectivity (Z) thresholds of 10 dBZ and 37.5 dBZ, respectively. For the total rain area, it is found that 3DCNN outperformed both the 3DNOW and persistence forecast, showing the higher threat scores for all lead times. For the convective rain area, the 3DCNN and 3DNOW's performances were similar at early lead times, showing almost the same threat scores. However, the threat score of 3DCNN dropped lower than that of 3DNOW at a lead time of 10 min, indicating that 3DNOW has the better skill at relatively long lead times. Nowcasts of 3DNOW showed a limitation to yield a larger saturated Z area related to increased errors in advection vectors at longer lead times although this led to increasing the threat score.},

  abstract = {It remains a challenge to obtain an accurate middle and long-term runoff forecast, especially in flood seasons. The forecast performance can be improved using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to produce cleaner signals as model inputs. In many EEMD based forecast models, the entire time series are decomposed into several sub-series, and each sub-series is divided into calibration and validation datasets and forecasted by some common models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), and finally an ensemble forecast is obtained by summing the forecasted results of each sub-series. In such a decomposition-ensemble framework, some future information is used, and thus it is a hindcast experiment. Attempts have also been made to propose a real forecast experiment, which, however, often cannot be able to adapt to the non-stationary changes in runoff due to the lack of adaptive ability. Therefore, this study tries to improve the decomposition-ensemble framework and propose an adaptive middle and long-term runoff forecast model especially for flood seasons. Unlike a hindcast experiment, it does not use any future information; and unlike conventional forecast experiments, its decomposition and forecast models are adjusted adaptively as long as new runoff information is added. EEMD is used to decompose the original time series and ANN is used to forecast each sub-series, hence the name an adaptive EEMD-ANN (AEEMD-ANN) model. This model is applied to forecast the 1-month ahead streamflow of three stations in China, and the results show that the AEEMD-ANN model can improve forecast accuracy in flood seasons, but it is not as good as ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and seasonal first-order autoregressive (SAR (1)) models in dry seasons. While the conventional forecast models, especially the SAR (1) models, are more suitable in dry season. Therefore, it is recommended to use SAR (1) model in dry season and AEEMD-ANN model in flood season to forecast the monthly runoff in Yangtze River Basin.},

With the integration of a PV power into an existing hydropower reservoir system, the original operating rules need to be re-designed to improve operational performance. This study focuses on exploring long-term operating rules for such an integrated system using implicit stochastic optimization, which can address uncertainties in reservoir inflow and PV power. First, a long-term multi-objective optimization model for this system is established by maximizing the total energy production and assurance rate (i.e., reliability) simultaneously. The model is then solved using a dynamic programming technique. Operating rules are derived from the obtained optimal trajectory using a linear fitting method. Finally, a simulation-based optimization framework is used to refine the parameters of these rules. Our case study based on China's Longyangxia hybrid power system shows that: (1) a significant linear correlation between available energy and reservoir storage at the end of each time period, with fitting correlation coefficients above 0.9 for each month. Therefore, the available energy and reservoir storage at the end of each time period are selected, respectively, as independent variables and decision variables in the operating rules; (2) an improved average annual energy production and assurance rate are obtained for the hybrid system when considering complementary operations; and (3) the derived operating rules are effective in improving system benefits when compared with conventional operation. These findings are helpful to offer guidelines for the effective operation of the hydro/PV hybrid power system.},

  abstract = {Runoff prediction plays an important role in the construction of intelligent hydraulic engineering. Most of the existing deep learning runoff prediction models use recurrent neural networks for single-step prediction of a single time series, which mainly model the temporal features and ignore the river convergence process within a watershed. In order to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction, a dynamic spatiotemporal graph neural network model (DSTGNN) is proposed considering the interaction of hydrological stations. The sequences are first input to the spatiotemporal block to extract spatiotemporal features. The temporal features are captured by the long short-term memory network (LSTM) with the self-attention mechanism. Then, the upstream and downstream distance matrices are constructed based on the river network topology in the basin, the dynamic matrix is constructed based on the runoff sequence, and the spatial dependence is captured by combining the above two matrices through the diffusion process. After that, the residual sequences are input to the next layer by the decoupling block, and, finally, the prediction results are output after multi-layer stacking. Experiments are conducted on the historical runoff dataset in the Upper Delaware River Basin, and the MAE, MSE, MAPE, and NSE were the best compared with the baseline model for forecasting periods of 3 h, 6 h, and 9 h. The experimental results show that DSTGNN can better capture the spatiotemporal characteristics and has higher prediction accuracy.},
